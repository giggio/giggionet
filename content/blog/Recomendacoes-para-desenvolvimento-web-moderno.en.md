Web development is constantly evolving and it is important to stay up to date with best practices. Here are some
essential recommendations for 2024:

Use modern frameworks such as React, Vue.js or Svelte to build interactive interfaces. They offer an excellent balance
between performance and productivity.

Adopt TypeScript in your projects. Static typing helps prevent bugs and improves code maintainability. The initial
learning curve is worth the investment.

Implement Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to offer a quality mobile experience. PWAs allow installation on the device and
work offline.

Focus on performance from the beginning:

- Optimize images and assets
- Implement code splitting
- Use lazy loading to load resources on demand
- Monitor metrics such as Core Web Vitals

Accessibility should not be an afterthought. Use tools such as axe DevTools to test and fix accessibility issues during
development.

Finally, keep your dependencies up to date and monitor for security vulnerabilities using tools like npm audit or Snyk.
