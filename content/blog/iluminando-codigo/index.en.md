Using code highlighting makes it easier to read and understand code, allowing essential elements to be identified
quickly.

This technique is especially useful for developers who review complex snippets, where syntax differentiation makes
learning more accessible.

```csharp {hl_Lines=[1 6-7]}
var a = 1;
var b = "hello";

class Foo
{
public int Id {get; set;}
public int Name {get; set;}
}
```

Organization and creativity in the visual design of codes help in maintenance and problem solving. When highlighting is
well applied, the programmer can identify errors and inconsistencies more quickly and intuitively, optimizing their
workflow.

Modern development tools offer robust resources to configure and customize code highlighting, according to the language
or project. This contributes to standardization and visual consistency within the technical team, facilitating code
sharing and review.

The impact of code highlighting goes beyond the aesthetic aspect; it directly influences the efficiency of understanding
and knowledge transfer among members of a development team. By emphasizing key elements, code snippets become more
didactic and clear.

In short, the use of highlighting techniques not only beautifies the code, but also makes it more accessible for
analysis and learning. This practice is essential for those seeking to improve the quality and maintenance of software
projects.
