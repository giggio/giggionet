Fifteen years ago, I shut down my personal website and blog and redirected the domain `giggio.net` to the website of the
company I had created, Lambda3. My blog,
[.NET Unplugged](https://web.archive.org/web/20101014051650/http://unplugged.giggio.net/), was transferred
to the company's blog, with the posts integrated there.

Today, one year and three months after leaving the company, I’m revisiting that — perhaps slightly outdated — idea of
writing on the internet autonomously, without depending on a platform or a billionaire’s social network.

The first time I did this was about 25 years ago. Just like back then, this site has an [RSS feed](/blog/index.xml),
reflecting my insistence on keeping the online world more anarchic and free of intermediaries. I still use RSS to access
a variety of content, and I believe everyone should give it a try: less doom scrolling and more deep reading. At the
bottom, in the footer, there’s a list of some of these sources, which I plan to expand into a “friends’ blogs” section
(another idea over 25 years old) and include other blogs I follow. There’s also a section listing some of the countless
podcasts I listen to. This initial version of the site is an MVP, and much more is coming.

(For those who don't know what RSS is: it's a way to distribute content without depending on any platform. I use a free
RSS reader called [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/). Try creating an account there and putting `giggio.net/en`
there as your first feed to see how it works.)

I’m creating this space to express my ideas in a more structured way. Besides blogging, I’ve been writing long posts on
BlueSky and Twitter for many years — a spontaneous form of expression. Over the last year, I felt the need for a space
to develop something more elaborate than a 15-minute thought. And that’s exactly what I’m doing here.

If you’re here expecting me to talk only about technology, rest assured, I will. But I also plan to reflect on politics,
philosophy, and other topics that, frankly, I can’t yet predict. I’m already organizing the posts into categories, so if
you prefer to follow just one subject, that’s perfectly fine. And, of course, everything is available via RSS. I’ll also
use tags more freely — also with RSS support. I’ll always let you know on social media whenever I write something I find
interesting, so it’s worth following me on one of those platforms. Right now, I’m most active on BlueSky 🦋, where I go
by [giggio.net](https://bsky.app/profile/giggio.net).

For the first time, I’m also publishing in English. The whole site was built with support for this language, and I
plan to translate much of what I publish in Brazilian. Now you can share my posts with your friends and colleagues who
don’t speak our language.

Between my personal blog and the one at Lambda3, I’ve published over 700 posts. I’m proud to have written most of them,
but unfortunately, they’re currently unavailable for reading, since the company’s old site is blocked and the posts
weren’t republished. On the other hand, many of them need to be reviewed — they’ve become outdated, or my opinions have
changed. I plan to review each one and re-edit the best ones, updating them to reflect what I think today and the
current state of technology. It’ll be an interesting process, both to have fun with my own youthful naivety and to see
where I got it right or wrong in my predictions. In any case, some content remains very relevant and deserves to see the
light of day again. And for those who didn’t know me many years ago, I believe many will enjoy reading these ideas.
Let’s see how it goes.

This space starts off simple, with a few sections. I have an area where I list some of my most recent contributions to
the software community and related fields (with some older gems). There, you’ll find videos, interviews, podcasts,
lectures, and other content—useful for those who want to access material they might have missed. And, again, everything
is available via RSS. There’s also a section where I introduce myself, a contact page, a search function, and that’s it
for now.

Soon, I’ll write a post explaining in detail how this site was built. I can already share the basics: all the content is
free and available on GitHub at [giggio/giggionet](https://github.com/giggio/giggionet/). The site was built
using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is absurdly fast and loaded with features. I’m
seriously impressed by the tool’s capabilities — it sometimes comes close to what a dynamic site can deliver. This site,
with around 200 files, is generated in 539 milliseconds, while the development server rebuilds this page in 21
milliseconds, with hot reload. An excellent user experience.

I built the entire site with a focus on web standards and accessibility. It scores a perfect 100 on
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/), both on mobile and desktop. I’m not an accessibility
expert, but I had help from
[Marcelo Sales](https://twitter.com/msales) from [tudoeacessibilidade.com.br](https://tudoeacessibilidade.com.br/), who
gave me some valuable tips on what to check. I’ll talk a bit more about that when I post about how the site was built.
If you’re blind or have low vision and notice any difficulty in reading or navigating the site, please let me know —
I’ll make sure to fix whatever isn’t working.

Since the code is freely hosted on GitHub, the site is obviously hosted on GitHub Pages, which, when the site is public,
offers hosting, a custom domain and HTTPS certificate for free. This is so powerful that I plan to recommend it to many
people and organizations, like NGOs etc. In 2025, all you need to have a public site is a domain — the rest is free.
What a wonderful moment!

And, since everything is on GitHub, I’m open to corrections, suggestions, and the like. Soon, I’ll add a link to make
this easier, something like an “edit this on GitHub” link on each page. The backlog will also be moved there soon, using
Github Issues.

I’ll start by getting out of my head those posts I’ve been meaning to write for over a year. Besides diving deeper into
some technologies, I plan to elaborate on topics like home automation, Hugo, the PC I built last year, politics, and my
current state.

Welcome to this (re)start. I hope you enjoy it. At the end of each post, there’s a comments section — feel free to join
in. It’s also based on GitHub (discussions), which helps avoid spam and, therefore, is free.

See you in the next posts.
