Blockchain may seem intimidating to beginners, but the basic concepts are simpler than they seem. This guide will help
you understand the basics.

A blockchain is essentially a distributed ledger that records transactions in an immutable way. Each block contains:

- Hash of the previous block
- Timestamp
- Transaction data
- Nonce (used for mining)

The concept of consensus is fundamental: nodes in the network need to agree on the current state of the blockchain. The
most common mechanisms are:

- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Stake (PoS)

To start developing, I recommend:

1. Studying Solidity for smart contracts
2. Using Hardhat as a development environment
3. Testing with Ganache
4. Interacting via Web3.js or Ethers.js

Remember: always test on testnets before using the mainnet.
