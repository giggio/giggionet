The DevOps landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and some tools have become indispensable for modern teams. Let's
explore the main tools that every DevOps professional should know in 2024.

Terraform remains the top choice for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). With its new native JSON format, the tool has become
even more flexible for automation.

For monitoring, the Prometheus + Grafana stack remains unbeatable. The integration with OpenTelemetry has brought more
possibilities for distributed observability.

In terms of CI/CD, GitHub Actions has gained even more prominence, especially with:

- Better support for containers
- Improved dependency caching
- New self-hosted runners
- Native integration with dependabot

ArgoCD has established itself as the preferred tool for GitOps, facilitating continuous deployment in Kubernetes
clusters.

For security, Snyk and Trivy are essential for scanning containers and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
