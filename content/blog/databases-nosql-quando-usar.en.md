Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases doesn't have to be difficult. See the ideal scenarios for each type of NoSQL database.

Document Stores (MongoDB, CouchDB):

- Unstructured data
- Flexible schemas
- Applications with a lot of writes

Key-Value Stores (Redis, DynamoDB):

- Cache
- Sessions
- Message queues
- High performance

Column-Family (Cassandra):

- Big Data
- Logs
- Time series

Graph Databases (Neo4j):

- Social networks
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
