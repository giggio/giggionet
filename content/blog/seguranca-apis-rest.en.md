Security in REST APIs is essential to protect data and resources. Here are the main practices that every developer
should implement.

Authentication and Authorization:

- Use JWT tokens with short expiration
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for authorization
- Maintain a list of revoked tokens
- Never store secrets in code

Essential Security Headers:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options

Rate Limiting:

- Implement per-IP/user limits
- Use exponential backoff
- Monitor for suspicious patterns

Data Validation:

- Sanitize all input
- Validate types and formats
- Use schemas for validation
- Escape data on output

HTTPS is mandatory in production, no exceptions.
